This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# React-app model

This is a simple react app model that you can use to start building your react projects.

##Getting started

### Cloning the repository

To start building with this model, you can just download the zip file or clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Levysantiago/react-app-model.git
```

### Installing dependences

To install all dependences just run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Configuring environment variables

You can set your environment-specific variables by creating a `.env` file, and use the [.env.example](https://github.com/Levysantiago/react-app-model/blob/master/.env.example) as example:

```
APP_NAME=ReactModel
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=5000
```

### Folder structure

After the steps, your project should look like this:

```
react-model/
  node_modules/
  public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    manifest.json
  src/
    components/
    lib/
